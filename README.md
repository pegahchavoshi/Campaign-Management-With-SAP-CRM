In this project, the aim is to plan and execute marketing activities using SAP CRM. In this case study, I will be playing the role of a salesperson. I will use the SALESPRO role to create a new customer account that brings high value to the enterprise. Following this, I will prepare customer calls and appointments, execute them professionally, and print information about the new customer account.
